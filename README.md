# Pairs Strategy

## Logic

The logic behind the pairs strategy is that stocks that tend to move together historically will tend to continue moving together, so when a certain pair starts diverging one would expect the stocks to converge again. This opens the possibility of opening both long and short positions to make a riskless profit: one can short the stock that when up and buy the stock that went down. In theory one would not need any investment because the funds from the short position would be used to cover the long position. 

## Methodology

In this project was analysed over 700 hundred stocks and was selected the top 10 pairs of stocks that move the most similar. The process is as follows:

1.	The price actions of all stocks for a period of 1 year (252 days) is normalised assuming that in day 0 the value of all the stocks is 1. Then simply was added the return of the day over 1 year.
2.	Then for every possible pair of stocks, is computed the squared differences in their normalised values computed in step 1 and those squared differences are added up. From this step, the output is a matrix showing the sum of the squared differences of the normalised values among every possible pair of stock.
3.	The top 10 pairs with the lowest values in the matrix are selected. In addition, the mean and standard deviation of the squared differences during the year for each pair of stock is calculated.
4.	The top 10 pairs are traded for the following 6 months (125 days). Everyday during those 6 months, the squared differences of the normalised values continue to be computed. There is a signal to open both long and short positions when the normalised value in a certain day is higher than two times the standard deviation plus the avg squared differences of the last year (This data was computed on step 3). 
5.	There is a signal to close an open position when the squared differences of the normalised value equals the avg squared differences of the last year. 
6.	I repeat these steps after the 125 days (6 months) are over.

## Key Takeaways, challenges, and future development

*	There are pairs that never converge, leading to relatively large drawdowns in some pairs.
*	There are pairs that converge after several years. There is a visual representation of this in the below graph (time period from 1996 to 2004):

*	As can be seen from the graph above, the best trades are the ones in which there is a signal to close the position within 400 hundred days (vertical blue line). There is a string relationship between the number of days trading and the return, sharpe ratio, and the max drawdown. 
*	Based on the above results, was discovered that closing automatically the positions when theyâ€™ve been trading for over 800 hundred days can reduce the risk of the strategy. The likelihood of those pairs converging is really low and we minimise the looses of the strategy.
*	The strategy was tweaked based on the above findings and there is a huge improvement (2004-2021):

*	The strategy has potential, but there is more research to be done. One must find the optimal number of days in which to close a position automatically to maximise the returns and minimise the potential drawdowns. As well one could do research to see if a stop loss could work rather than closing a position based on trading days. 
* Additionally, one major drawback in live implementation is the spread among pairs that have low liquidity. Some of the pairs that were selected by the algorithm have really low liquidity, hence the spreads are huge and reducing the margin of the trade. One should filter out stocks that have low liquidity, because they are not really profitable in a live implementation of the strategy.
